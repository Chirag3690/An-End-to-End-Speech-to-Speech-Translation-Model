# Streamlit App: An-End-to-End-Speech-to-Speech-Translation-Model

This repository demonstrates how a simple voice transfer app can be created using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). The code for this demo is based on the repository for [Real-Time-Voice-Cloning](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning).

This app allows you to:
* Record your voice
* Visualize the embedding of the speaker
* Synthesize speech based on the recorded voice


## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements
**Python 3.6 or 3.7** is needed

* Create your virtual environment (e.g. [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).
* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=1.0.1).
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).
* Run `pip install -r requirements_demo.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.

### 2. Download Pretrained Models
Download the latest [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. Run App

* `streamlit run demo_voice.py`
